      "message": "(minor) The reference time to compute the speedup is no longer based on the real getpwuid/getgrgid. Here, it will just compute the difference of performance between get+set in the cache, and get only.\n\nIsn\u0027t this possible to have a first loop that runs real getpwuid even for a smaller number of uid/gid (as this test is single-threaded, it can use the non-reentrant version of getpwuid/getgrgid that are not overridden to make this reference value). The speedup of your next patches will be even more spectacular :)",
