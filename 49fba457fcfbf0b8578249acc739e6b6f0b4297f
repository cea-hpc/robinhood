I don\u0027t have access:\n\n [commentlink \"github\"]\n  match \u003d \"#(\\\\d+)\"\n  link \u003d https://github.com/cea-hpc/robinhood/issues/$1\n\n(this is a bit of a broad match, but github is very lax with its syntax, a full regex (untested) would be something like match \u003d \"(close[sd]?|fix(e[sd])?|resolve[sd]?):? #(\\\\d+)\" and $3 in the link... perhaps? Just matching #number is probably good enough, not like false positives do any harm)\n)",
