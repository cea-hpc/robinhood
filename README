II - Compiling
==============

2.1 - From source tarball
-------------------------

It is advised to build RobinHood on your target system, to ensure the best
compatibility with your Lustre and MySQL versions. 
 
Build requirements: glib2-devel, libattr-devel, mysql-devel or mariadb-devel,
mailx, bison, flex.
For lustre support: lustre or lustre-client, libuuid-devel

Unzip and untar the source distribution:
> tar zxvf robinhood-3.x.x.tar.gz
> cd robinhood-3.x.x

Configure and build:
> ./configure
> make rpm

RPMs are generated in the 'rpms/RPMS/<arch>' directory.

2.2 - From git repository
-------------------------

# Install git, and autotools stuff:
yum install git automake autoconf libtool

# retrieve robinhood sources
git clone https://github.com/cea-hpc/robinhood.git
cd robinhood
git checkout master (or other branch)
sh autogen.sh

Then refer to section 2.1 for next compilation steps.

III - Install
=============

For installing robinhood on your target system, install the following RPM:
    > robinhood-adm
	It includes configuration helper for DB, changelogs, ...

* For lustre filesystems install:
    > robinhood-lustre

* For other filesystems install:
    > robinhood-posix

IV - Database Configuration
===========================

Robinhood needs a MySQL database for storing information about files.
This database can run on a different node from Robinhood daemon.

* Install MySQL server on the machine (mysql-server and mysql packages).
* Start the DB engine:
	RHEL6: service mysqld start
	RHEL7: systemctl start mariadb
* Run the configuration helper script as root on the database host:
	# create robinhood's database:
	> rbh-config create_db

* Write the DB password to a file with read access for root only (600)
  e.g. to /etc/robinhood.d/.dbpassword

Note: initially, the database schema is empty. Robinhood will create it the first time it is launched.

V - Lustre 2.x Filesystems only: enabling changelogs
====================================================
For Lustre, you must register robinhood as a MDT changelog consumer.

* Run the configuration helper script on Lustre MDS:
	> rbh-config enable_chglogs
  This registers a changelog consumer and activate required changelog records.

Note: by default, the script checks for a 'cl1' consumer.
If you need to register several changelog consumers on your file system,
refer to lustre documentation.

VI - Configuration file
=======================
Examples of config files are installed in /etc/robinhood.d/templates/

You can also use the '--template' option to generate a documented configuration file template:
> robinhood --template=<template_file>

For more details, refer to Robinhood v3 documentation:
    https://github.com/cea-hpc/robinhood/wiki/robinhood_v3_admin_doc

Note: by default, robinhood searches configuration files in "/etc/robinhood.d".

VII - First run
===============

Even if your filesystem is empty, you need to perform an initial scan in order to initialize robinhood database.
This prevents from having entries in filesystem that it wouldn't know about.
robinhood --scan --once

VIII - Start the daemon
=======================
Configure daemon options in /etc/sysconfig/robinhood
Example: to read lustre changelogs and run all policies:
  RBH_OPT="--readlog --run=all"
Example: to regularly scan filesystem and run all policies:
  RBH_OPT="--scan --run=all"

Starting the daemon:
RHEL6: service robinhood start
RHEL7: systemctl start robinhood
