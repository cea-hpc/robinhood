Main changes in robinhood 3.0:
* Policies at will:
    - Define new custom policies at will, just by writting just a few lines of configuration.
    - Schedule all imaginable actions on filesystem entries.
    - Templates are provided to implement: old entries cleanup, directory cleanup, data corruption checks (by regularly checking file's checksum), Lustre/HSM policies.
* Fully configurable policies:
    - All policy aspects made configurable (scope, actions, action parameters, sort order...)
    - Fine-grained specification of policy actions and parameters.
* Plugin-based architecture:
    - Missing a specific feature in Robinhood core? Implement you own plugin to manage new kind of policies, maintain specific info in robinhood DB, enable interactions with specific site ecosystem (job scheduler, system load...), ...
* Enabling the Robinhood community:
    - Share your custom policy definitions and plugins, so that other community members can benefit from them and enrich them!
* All Robinhood features in a single instance:
    - No more distinct and incompatible robinhood "flavors" (tmpfs, lhsm, backup...)
    - All policies can be implemented in a single robinhood instance.
* Get a better overlook of your filesystem contents than ever!
    - New web interface
    - REST interface to query filesystem stats
    - Tag your filesystem entries based on arbitrary criteria using the new fileclass implementation
    - Flexible reporting with "rbh-find -printf"
* RedHat 7 integration:
    - systemd support.
    - Per filesystem service: robinhood@<fsname>
* New features for Lustre/HSM:
    - Undelete: recover accidentally deleted files.
    - Implement Lustre/HSM with any backend, using the generic command copytool shipped with robinhood: 'lhsmtool_cmd'.
    - UUID support for Lustre/HSM copytools.
* Convenient:
    - Automatic DB conversion after major upgrades.
* Even more robust & Improved code quality.

Changes between version 2.5.4 and 2.5.5:
* [lustre] Support Lustre versions up to 2.7.
* [DB performance] Allow both batching and parallelizing DB operations when
  accounting is OFF. Benchmarks show a x3~x4 speedup of DB ingest rate in this
  case.
* [DB performance] Reduce lock contention on indexes of STRIPE_ITEMS table.
* [acct] Avoid accounting stats inconsistency when this feature is enabled/
  disabled/re-enabled.
* [policy performance] Disable ignored class re-matching by default.
* [policy performance] Disable sort by mtime by default.
* [policy performance] Allow disabling sort by atime for purge policies.
* [fix] Fix segfault when log rotation occurs under heavy logging.
* [fix] When processing a RENAME changelog record, match the new path in
  filesystem instead of building it from DB (which caused 'incomplete path'
  errors).
* [fix] Fix sendfile copy operation for backup mode.
* [fix] Fix various requests about directories: --topdirs with --filter-path
  option, --toprmdir, ...
* [fix] Fix possible duplicate insert error when updated entry attributes are
  only in ANNEX_INFO table (rare).
* [fix] Some purge parameters may not be taken into account.
* [packaging] clean permissions in distribution tarball.
* [report performance] Improve performance of path matching when running
  directory reports with --filter-path option.

Changes between version 2.5.3 and 2.5.4:
* [lustre] Lustre 2.4+: detect all stripe changes and update the DB accordingly.
* [scan] Prevent from dropping entries from DB when opendir or stat fail.
* [DB] Optimization to batch more DB requests.
* [DB] Allow using any MySQL engine (new config parameter: listmanager::mysql::engine)
* [rbh-config] Avoid backup_db to lock the whole tables with innodb.
* [bugfix] Improve robustness to corrupted mtimes.
* [bugfix] Fix possible crash in db_exec_sql.
* [bugfix] Fix possible overflow when executing a custom archive command.
* [backup mode] Clean all non-printable characters in backend path.
* [pkg] libattr-devel is now mandatory to build robinhood.

2.5.4 release notes:
* "innodb = enabled/disabled": this parameter will be deprecated.
  It has to be replaced by "engine = innodb".
* (Lustre only) one of the field types changed in the DB.
  It will be automatically converted the first time rbh 2.5.4 starts.
  The conversion takes about 5s per million entries.
* Admin guides are now available online (http://robinhood.sf.net > "Online documentation")
  "odt" and "pdf" versions are no longer maintained.

Changes in version 2.5.0:
Summary:
- filesystem disaster recovery features
- new namespace management (new DB schema to properly handle hardlinks, renames...)
- scanning and changelog processing optimizations
- database optimizations (requests batching)
- many other changes, improvements and code cleaning...

Details:
- rbh-diff:
    * new command to detect differences between the filesystem and the information
      in robinhood database.
    * option "--apply=fs" for disaster recovery purpose: restore the filesystem
      metadata from robinhood DB.
    * makes it possible to rebuild a Lustre MDT from scratch, or from a LVM snapshot
      (see "Robinhood Lustre disaster recovery guide" for more details).
- database:
    * new namespace implementation in database with new NAMES table (Cray contribution)
        - fixes/improves hardlink support
        - fixes/improves Lustre ChangeLog hardlink/rename/unlink support
        - saves DB storage space
    * database request batching: significantly increase database ingest rate.
      No longer needs innodb_flush_log_at_tx_commit != 1 to speed up DB operations.
    * additional information in DB that can help for disaster recovery:
      symlink info, access rights, stripe object indexes, stripe order, nlink...
    * set default commit behavior to transaction (prevent from DB inconsistencies)
    * optimized multi-table requests
    * optimization: minimized attribute set in DB update operations
      (don't update attributes that didn't change)
    * Fix: deal with mysql case insensitivity for string matching
    * triggers and stored procedures versioning mechanism
    * prevent from overflows for large INSERT requests, wide stripes...
    * prevent from DB deadlocks
- scanning:
    * --partial-scan option is deprecated and replaced by an optional argument to --scan (e.g. --scan=/fs/subdir).
    * better management of partial scans:
        - better detection of removed entries vs. entries moved from a directory to another.
        - partial scans can be used for initial DB population (even if the DB is initially empty).
    * garbage collection of removed entries in DB is a long operation when terminating a scan (and even more
      when terminating a partial scan). Added --no-gc option to skip it (recommanded for partial scans).
    * automatically enabling --no-gc if the DB is initially empty (eg. for initial scan).
    * optimization: use *at() functions (openat, fstatat) and readdir by chunk (using getdents) instead of POSIX lstat() and readdir_r().
    * optimization: use NOATIME flag to access entries as much as possible
    * optimizations of get_stripe and get_fid operations.
    * new --diff option for robinhood --scan and --readlog: output detected changes in a diff-like format.
- Lustre changelogs:
    * changelog batching (Cray contribution): to speed up changelog processing,
      robinhood retains changelog records in memory a short time,
      to aggregate similar/redundant Changelog records on the same entry before
      updating its database.
    * support multiple changelog readers (for DNE) as multiple threads (default)
      or as multiple processes, possibly on different hosts, by giving a MDT index
      to --readlog option.
    * resilience to filesystem umount/mount.
- rbh-report:
    * new option --entry-info to get all the stored information about an entry
    * option --dump-ost can now list multiple OSTs and support ranges notation (e.g. 3,5-8,12-23).
    * --dump-ost output indicates if a file has data on a given OST (could be striped on the OST but have no data on it).
- rbh-find:
    * new option -crtime to filter entries on creation time.
    * output ordering closer to find output
    * added missing info in 'rbh-find -ls' output (nlink, mode, symlink info...)
- robinhood-backup:
    * by default, use a built-in copy function to avoid the cost of forking copy commands.
    * rbh-backup-rebind: tool to rebind an entry in the backend if its fid changed in the filesystem
      for any reason (file copied to a new one to change its stripe, etc...)
    * rbh-backup-recov new features and options:
        --list (list information about entries to be recovered)
        --ost <ost_set> to only recover entries for a given set of OSTs (support range notation):
            the basic use-case is OST disaster recovery.
        --since <time> to only recover entries modified since a given date:
            the basic use case is after restoring an OST snapshot.
    * symlinks archiving to backend made optional (new parameter 'archive_symlinks')
      as they can now be restored using robinhood database information.
- configuration:
    * can specify environment variables in config file (e.g. fs_path = $ROOT_DIR ;)
    * prevent from using a wrong config file (Cray contribution):
        - only check files in /etc/robinhood.d/<purpose>, no longer in the current directory
        - fails if to many config files are available.

Changes between version 2.4.2 and 2.4.3:

        Previously based on last modification time, it can now be one of:
        creation, last_archive, last_mod, last_access.
   - [feature] special meaning for condition 'last_archive == 0':
        matches entries that have never been archived.
   - [feature] suspend migration if copy error rate exceed a threshold.
        This is controled by 'suspend_error_pct' and 'suspend_error_min' parameters.

  Faster way to search for entries in a filesystem!

  Performance comparison for a 1 million entries Lustre v2 filesystem
        find /lustre -user foo -type f -size -32M -ls
        (no possible criteria on OST index)
        > 58m13s

        (no possible criteria on size)
        > 20m46s

        rbh-find /lustre -user foo -type f -size -32M -ost 1 -ls
        > 1.2s

  (+additional section in webUI)
* Sorting user/groups by size range (eg. percentage of files < 1G)

  and CHANGELOG_FLAG_BLOCK options)
- Adapting to changes in changelog timestamp (secs+nano instead of jiffies)
- Use fid as primary key in database schema (for better performance)
- Added calls to llapi_hsm_request() to trigger migration, release, removal
  in HSM.
- Customizable migration hints to be passed to the copytool
- Command line options to trigger manual migrations (by user, by OST...)
- Deferred removal in HSM
- Taking HSM file status into account (dirty, released, ...)
- HSM event support
- Changelog flag support (for UNLINK and HSM event)
- Added '--ignore-policies' option to perform migration/purge to all eligible
  files without checking policy conditions.
