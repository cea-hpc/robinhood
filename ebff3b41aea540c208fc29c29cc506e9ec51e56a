      "message": "If the file is already tracked it will be shown as changed in git even if ignored, so I think it actually works out OK in practice (only need to pay attention when manually adding files there, which should be rare enough)\n\nOtherwise I was about to say we could unignore a subdir of /autotools but that doesn\u0027t seem to work.. I guess moving AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR is a bit overkill for that so I\u0027ll resign myself to just adding /autotools/test-driver whatever that is :)",
